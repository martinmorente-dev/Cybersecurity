### 📌 Explainer: What is the CIA Triad?

**Summary:**  
The **CIA Triad** is a foundational model in cybersecurity that represents three core principles necessary for protecting information:

- **Confidentiality:** Ensuring that sensitive data is only accessible to authorized individuals. This prevents data breaches, leaks, or unauthorized exposure.  
  *Example:* Encryption of customer data to prevent it from being accessed by unauthorized users.

- **Integrity:** Maintaining the accuracy and trustworthiness of data over its lifecycle. This includes protection from unauthorized modification or corruption.  
  *Example:* Version control systems that prevent unauthorized edits to documents or logs.

- **Availability:** Ensuring that data and systems are accessible when needed. This involves maintaining infrastructure, using backups, and defending against denial-of-service attacks.  
  *Example:* Having redundant servers and backup systems to prevent downtime during a cyberattack.

**Skills Applied:**  
- Concept explanation  
- Use of real-world analogies  
- Technical communication
